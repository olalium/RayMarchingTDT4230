// In case you haven't got much experience with C or C++, let me explain this "typedef" you see below.
// The point of a typedef is that you it, as its name implies, allows you to define arbitrary data types based upon existing ones. For instance, "typedef float typeWhichMightBeAFloat;" allows you to define a variable such as this one: "typeWhichMightBeAFloat variableName = 5.0;". The C/C++ compiler translates this type into a float. 
// What is the point of using it here? A smrt person, while designing the C language, thought it would be a good idea for various reasons to force you to explicitly state that you are using a data structure datatype (struct). So, when defining a variable, you'd have to type "struct SceneNode node = ..." in the case of a SceneNode. Which can get in the way of readability.
// If we just use typedef to define a new type called "SceneNode", which really is the type "struct SceneNode", we can omit the "struct" part when creating an instance of SceneNode.
